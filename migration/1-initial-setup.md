## Initial setup

### Kotlin version

The DevKit needs a minimum of Kotlin 2.3.20, so please upgrade and ensure your plugin works aptly before proceeding with the rest of the migration.
There's no reason to upgrade to a version higher than 2.3.20 during the setup. Please don't change your Kotlin version while migrating; it'll only complicate the process

### Settings (`settings.gradle.kts`)
Because the devkit is still highly experimental, you'll need to add:
```kotlin
pluginManagement {
	repositories {
		maven("https://packages.jetbrains.team/maven/p/compiler-plugin-dev-kit/eap")
	}
}
```
Apply the plugin:
```kotlin
plugins {
	kotlin("compiler.plugin.devkit") version "<blah>"
}
```
also add
```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
	repositories {
		maven("https://packages.jetbrains.team/maven/p/compiler-plugin-dev-kit/eap")
	}
}
```
so you get the DevKit dependencies!

You can remove manually-added `dev`, `bootstrap`, and `intellij-dependecies` repositores because the settings plugin adds them for you.

[comment]: # (TODO #55)

Find your plugin ID. If you're using the pre-devkit template, you'll have `build-config` setup that explicitly passes the plugin ID. If your plugin ID is different from your `group`, configure it in the settings directly: 
```kotlin
pluginDevKit { pluginPackage("my.plugin.id") }
```

If you have "companion" libraries, i.e. libraries that your compiler plugin always expects to exist, and thus should be added by the Gradle plugin and be available in tests, add them:
```kotlin
pluginDevKit {
	// project reference (if it's a project in the same build)
	companionLibrary(":my-plugin-annotations")
	// name (if it's under the same group and version, e.g. if it's in an included build)
	companionLibrary("my-plugin-annotations")
	// dependency notation
	companionLibrary("com.example:some-library:1.0.0")
}
```
In the pre-devkit template, `:plugin-annotations` is the companion library you should add.

Don't configure any version support ranges for now.
Your project should still build and run successfully.
